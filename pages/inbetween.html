        <h1>Over the Cee Scenario #1</h1>
        <h1>Mission Briefing:</h1>
        <h3>Slight overview:</h3>
        <p>It's the 18th of November 1918 and Latvia has declared itself a new republic! Currently in it's territory resides the German VI. Reserve Corps.</p>
        <p>Do not worry, it is tasked to defend Latvia from larger threats. Although the Red Army has invaded Latvia and taken over most of it's territory in 2 months.</p>
        <p>Now it is up to you Commander, to combine forces with the German VI. Reserve Corps and the Latvian National Army to take back our rightful territory!</p>
        <h3>High Command has issued new orders for the upcoming operation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Take back the cities of Rīga and Cēsis!</li>
            <li>Do not rely on the Germans too much, have atleast 1 Latvian Division alive by the end.</li>
            <li>You cannot lose the city of Liepāja, even if the Soviets do not annex Liepāja, you cannot lose it, this will result in an immediate loss.</li>
            <li>Do not push into Latgale, we do not have the resources to sustain our army so far. (This region has been marked in a darker colour)</li>
          </ul>
